This app is being built to make taking notes in lectures way easier. The idea is to record the audio, and then use AI to turn that audio into notes.

**What Works Now:**

* **Organize Your Notes:**  Create subjects (like "History" or "Calculus") and then add notes for individual lectures within those subjects. 
* **Convert Audio To Notes:**  Record lectures directly in the app, and convert them into notes via ai.


**What's Coming Soon:**

* **Sync Everywhere:** Access your notes on any device.
* **Export and Share:** Save your notes as PDFs, text files, or other formats.


**How It's Built:**

* **Flutter:** For the app's interface.
* **SQLite:** To store your notes on your device.
* **Gemini API:** To convert audio into notes.


**To-Do List:**

1. **Make it Look Better:** Improve the app's design.
5. **Sync to the Cloud:**  Make your notes accessible everywhere.
6. **Export Options:** Let you save your notes in different formats.
7. **Test and Improve:** Make sure everything works smoothly.
