This app is being built to make taking notes in lectures way easier. The idea is to record the audio, and then use AI to turn that audio into notes.

**What Works Now:**

* **Organize Your Notes:**  Create subjects (like "History" or "Calculus") and then add notes for individual lectures within those subjects. You can edit and delete subjects and lectures.
* **Edit Titles and Descriptions:** You can change the title and description of your lectures by long-pressing on them.
* **Save**


**What's Coming Soon:**

* **Record Audio:**  Record lectures directly in the app.
* **AI Magic:**  Let the AI transcribe your recordings and create notes for you. This will summarize the main points and pick out important terms.
* **Sync Everywhere:** Access your notes on any device.
* **Export and Share:** Save your notes as PDFs, text files, or other formats.


**How It's Built:**

* **Flutter:** For the app's interface.
* **SQLite:** To store your notes on your device.


**To-Do List:**

1. **Make it Look Better:** Improve the app's design.
2. **Add Recording:** Let you record audio.
3. **Bring in the AI:**  Connect to an AI service.
4. **Edit Text:** Make the notes editable.
5. **Sync to the Cloud:**  Make your notes accessible everywhere.
6. **Export Options:** Let you save your notes in different formats.
7. **Test and Improve:** Make sure everything works smoothly.
